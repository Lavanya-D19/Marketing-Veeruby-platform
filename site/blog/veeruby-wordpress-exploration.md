## Why WordPress?

As Veeruby grows, we are exploring WordPress as a flexible solution for our marketing and content needs. Its open-source nature and vast plugin ecosystem make it a strong candidate for our platform.

## Evaluation Process

- Compared WordPress with other CMS options
- Tested custom themes and plugins
- Assessed scalability and security

## Next Steps

We will continue to prototype and gather feedback from our team. If WordPress meets our requirements, it could become a core part of the Veeruby marketing stack.
