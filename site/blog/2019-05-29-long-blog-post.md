I started with the Beginner Track, learning the fundamentals of marketing. Each module challenged me to apply new concepts and complete practical tasks. As I progressed, I built real campaigns, analyzed results, and earned my certificate. The LMS made it easy to track my progress and connect with mentors.

If youâ€™re new to Veeruby, dive into the tracks and make the most of every module!
