# How to Use

1. Start at the **[Home](./index.md)** page and choose a track.
2. Open a module → read **Outcomes** → finish **Tasks** → take **Quiz**.
3. Save your work as **Evidence** (PDF/screenshots) in `/assets/downloads`.
4. Use the **Resources** for reading lists and templates.
5. Suggest fixes via pull requests; log changes in `/admin/ADMIN_Update_Log.md`.

> ✅ Keep commits small and messages clear. That’s how we scale.
